Awesome — I visited your GitHub profile: https://github.com/Noopurkm
 and here’s how to make it actually work for getting interviews.

Right now it looks like this:

Only one repo (the GitHub Pages one)

No software projects uploaded

No clear portfolio to show recruiters

But you’re already on the right track. Let’s fix it step by step.

✅ What your GitHub should look like (simple, clean, professional)
1️⃣ Your Profile:

Make sure your profile bio includes:

✨ A short title:

Aspiring Software Developer | Python | SQL | APIs | Git


✨ A link to your LinkedIn (paste it next to your bio)

Bio example:

Aspiring Software Developer | Python + SQL | Projects on GitHub | LinkedIn: link

🚀 Important Next Steps (do this today)

You need at least 2–3 real project repositories that look like software work.

Let’s create them one by one.
